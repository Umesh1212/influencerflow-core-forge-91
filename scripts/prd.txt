Product Requirements Document: InfluencerFlow AI Platform
Version: 1.0
Date: [Current Date]
Project Handle: opraahfx
Category: AI Agents

1. Introduction & Vision
-------------------------
Influencer marketing is a rapidly growing industry, yet it's hampered by manual, inefficient, and fragmented processes. InfluencerFlow AI Platform aims to revolutionize this space by providing an AI-powered, automated solution that streamlines the entire influencer marketing workflow. Our vision is to create a unified ecosystem where brands and creators can connect, collaborate, and transact with unprecedented ease, speed, accuracy, and fairness, facilitated by intelligent automation and personalized interactions.

2. Goals
---------
- To automate and streamline the end-to-end influencer marketing workflow, from discovery to payment and reporting.
- To reduce the manual effort and inefficiencies currently faced by brands, agencies, and creators.
- To improve transparency, consistency, and fairness in influencer collaborations, especially for creators in emerging markets.
- To provide a scalable solution capable of managing high volumes of campaigns effectively.
- To leverage AI for personalized outreach, negotiation, and intelligent recommendations.

3. Target Audience / User Personas (Implicit)
-------------------------------------------
- **Brands/Marketing Agencies:** Seeking efficient discovery, scalable outreach, automated contract/payment processes, and clear ROI tracking.
- **Creators (especially in emerging markets):** Seeking fair opportunities, clear communication (multilingual), timely payments, and professional interaction.
- **Platform Administrators:** Requiring tools for user management, data health monitoring, and platform oversight.

4. Problem Statement
--------------------
Influencer marketing is growing rapidly, but the process remains highly manual, inefficient, and fragmented. Brands and agencies struggle with discovering the right creators, reaching out at scale, negotiating deals, handling contracts, tracking performance, and processing payments- often across spreadsheets, emails, and WhatsApp. This leads to missed opportunities, slow turnarounds, inconsistent pricing, and a poor experience for both creators and marketers.

On the other side, creators - especially in emerging markets -face language barriers, delayed payments, and unclear expectations, as most lack professional management. There is no unified platform that brings automation, Al, and personalization to streamline this ecosystem.

The industry needs a scalable solution that can manage high volumes of campaigns while delivering speed, accuracy, and fairness.

5. Proposed Solution: InfluencerFlow AI Platform
----------------------------------------------
We aim to solve this by building an AI-powered platform that automates the entire influencer marketing workflow from creator discovery and outreach to negotiation, contracts, payments, and performance reporting - with multilingual communication and human-like AI agents that can scale personalized interactions. All backend logic, API integrations, and AI orchestrations will be handled using Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage, and Edge Functions written in TypeScript/Deno).

6. Functional Requirements (Expected Outcome / Key Features)
---------------------------------------------------------
**6.1. Creator Discovery Engine**
    - A searchable, filterable database of creators (data stored in Supabase PostgreSQL) across platforms (YouTube, Instagram, etc.).
    - AI-powered prompt search that returns relevant creator recommendations (logic in Supabase Edge Function calling embedding and search services, or performing vector search within Postgres itself).
    - Creator profile cards with audience insights, engagement metrics, and past collaborations (data fetched from Supabase DB).

**6.2. AI Outreach & Negotiation System**
    - Automated email and voice-based outreach in the creator's preferred language (orchestrated by Supabase Edge Functions calling LLM, Translation, ElevenLabs, and Email APIs).
    - AI agent capable of handling basic negotiation (rates, deliverables, timelines) (logic within Supabase Edge Functions, state managed in Supabase DB, calling LLM APIs).
    - All communications logged in a CRM-style interface (data in Supabase DB, real-time updates via Supabase Realtime).

**6.3. Contract Automation**
    - Auto-generated contracts based on confirmed deals (Supabase Edge Function generating PDF from template, using data from Supabase DB).
    - E-signature integration (e.g., DocuSign or similar, called from Supabase Edge Function) and contract status tracking (in Supabase DB).

**6.4. Payments Module**
    - Smart invoicing and milestone-based payout flow (logic in Supabase Edge Functions, data in Supabase DB).
    - Dashboard for creators and brands to track payments (frontend calls Supabase directly or via simple getter Edge Functions).
    - Stripe/Razorpay integration for payment processing (webhook handling and API calls managed by Supabase Edge Functions).

**6.5. Campaign Tracker & Performance Dashboard**
    - Real-time tracking of creator content via API integrations (Supabase Edge Functions periodically calling YouTube/Instagram APIs, storing results in Supabase DB).
    - Auto-generated performance reports (views, engagement, ROI, etc.) (data aggregation by Supabase Edge Functions or complex SQL views, served to frontend).

**6.6. Admin Panel**
    - Tools to manage creators, users, campaigns, and data health (frontend directly interacts with Supabase DB using RLS, or via admin-specific Edge Functions).
    - Role-based access for brands, agencies, creators, and internal admins (leveraging Supabase Auth roles and RLS).

7. MVP Scope & Functional Requirement
-------------------------------------
**7.1. MVP Live Demo Goal:**
    - A working version of the platform demonstrating an end-to-end campaign lifecycle:
      (Search → Outreach → Deal → Contract → Payment → Report) through mock or live data.

**7.2. MVP Core End-to-End Use Case Requirement:**
    - All modules listed in Section 6 must be functional to support at least one complete end-to-end use case for the demo.

8. Technical Requirements & Tech Stack Overview
---------------------------------------------
**8.1. Frontend**
    - Framework: React.js or Next.js (preferred for SSR and scalability) with Vite.
    - Styling: Tailwind CSS or ShadCN UI components.
    - State Management: React Query or Zustand (for API/data state).
    - Supabase Client: `supabase-js` for direct interaction with Supabase services.

**8.2. Backend & Core Infrastructure (Supabase Only)**
    - **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (for structured creator, campaign, transaction data, etc.).
    - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Google OAuth preferred, email/password).
    - **Server-Side Logic & APIs:** Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript/Deno) for all business logic, external API calls, AI orchestration, and serving any custom API endpoints if needed beyond direct DB access.
    - **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for media, contract PDFs, generated voice files).
    - **Real-time Features:** Supabase Realtime (e.g., for chat, notifications).
    - **Search Layer:** Supabase vector columns with pgVector for semantic search, or Edge Functions calling external search APIs like Pinecone/Elasticsearch if absolutely necessary (preference for Supabase internal capabilities).
    - **Caching/Queueing:** Redis or RabbitMQ (if complex background jobs are needed beyond Supabase's capabilities, this might imply an external service called by Edge Functions, or leverage Supabase internal cron jobs for simpler queuing).

**8.3. AI/ML & Voice Integration (All orchestrated via Supabase Edge Functions)**
    - **LLM API Calls:** OpenAI GPT-4 (for outreach drafting, negotiation, recommendations).
    - **Voice AI:** ElevenLabs (for voice synthesis), Whisper (for speech-to-text).
    - **Language Translation:** Deepl or Google Translate API.
    - **Custom Embeddings:** OpenAI/Cohere (for matching creators with briefs).

**8.4. Third-Party Integrations (All orchestrated via Supabase Edge Functions)**
    - **Payments:** Razorpay or Stripe (with webhook-based automation).
    - **Email:** Gmail API or SendGrid (for branded communications).
    - **Influencer Platform APIs:** YouTube Data API, Instagram Graph API (for performance metrics).
    - **E-Signature:** DocuSign or native integration using PDF templates and audit trails.

**8.5. DevOps & Deployment**
    - **Hosting:** Vercel (for frontend) + Supabase (managed platform).
    - **Monitoring:** Sentry (error tracking for frontend and Edge Functions), PostHog or Mixpanel (user analytics), Supabase built-in logs.
    - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (for frontend builds/deployments, Supabase schema migrations via Supabase CLI, Edge Function deployments).
    - **Version Control:** Git (GitHub or GitLab).
